<h1>Best Psychology and Decision-Making Books</h1>

From day-to-day stuff to life-defining decisions, decision-making is a never-ending phenomenon of conscious existence. If you are reading this, you are choosing to read this instead of doing something else. Everything we do in life is essentially a decision, a choice. An understanding of human psychology can greatly improve the way we go about our lives because we can make better predictions about what will make us better off, and avoid potential pitfalls. Here are the best books on understanding how the mind works and using that wisdom to make better decisions.

<h2>Thinking Fast and Slow, by Daniel Kahneman</h2>

</div>

Dr. Kahneman is a Nobel laureate in Economics and this book is based on his research and findings done with his colleague Amos Tversky. It is about two systems of the mind: <b>System 1</b> which is fast, automatic and instinctive; and <b>System 2</b> which is slow, calculative and intelligent. The book goes into how our thinking is often distorted because of cognitive biases and the implications of the same in economics, finance, and day-to-day decisions. It will change the way you think about your own decisions. You will acknowledge the limits of your abilities, the role of luck and randomness in life. You will appreciate the importance of evidence, statistics and rationality, you will awe at the complexity of the world and of the human mind. It will improve your decision-making in all spheres of life. A slightly difficult read, with a theoretical bent at places, but without doubt it's worth the effort. A mind-altering book, to say the least.

<h3>The book is divided into 5 parts:</h3>

<ol>
  <li><b>Two Systems</b>: An introduction to how our thinking is be divided into two systems</li>
  <li><b>Heuristics and Biases</b>: More about psychology, in what ways is our brain flawed</li>
  <li><b>Overconfidence</b>: Our illusions and irrational confidence in our beliefs relying on coherence rather than evidence, insights about stock markets, forecasting, etc. </li>
  <li><b>Choices</b>: Past theories of choice and utility, Dr. Kahneman's new prospect theory; why we make the choices we make</li>
  <li><b>Two Selves</b>: The experiencing self and the remembering self, their distinction and finally its implications in life</li>
</ol>

I found Parts 3 and 4 the most enlightening. Prospect theory has been a paradigm-shifting theory in Behavioral economics that explains how the assumption in classical Economics that human agents make rational decisions is violated because of psychological biases, and how we ascribe value and utility to the expected outcomes of our decisions.

<h3>What I liked the most in this book:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Skepticism and rigorous scientific arguments, and advice given thereby</li>
  <li>The connection of psychology, neuroscience and the brain's evolutionary history with economics, decision-making and choices</li>
  <li>The feeling of awe after realizing how I often make bad choices in day-to-day life, or how a particular thinking pattern works without me even noticing.</li>
  <li>The feeling of humility after realizing how flawed my mind is, driven by emotion rather than rationality</li>
</ul>
