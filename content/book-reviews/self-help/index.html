<h1>Best Self-Improvement Books</h1>

There are thousands of self-help books out there and most of them give generic advice on how one should live their life. Many of them are such that you might feel motivated for a while after reading them but in the end you often realise that nothing has actually changed. Unfortunately, there is lack of scientific validity to a lot of self-help advice, and hence the burden of checking and validating what actually works rests on the reader. Because of this, we must be very choosy in picking up self-help books. Here, I have compiled reviews of those self-help books which I find truly good and actionable, books that give concrete advice in their respective domain.

<h2>The Subtle Art of Not Giving A F*ck, by Mark Manson</h2>

</div>
<p>It’s a superb no-nonsense guide to understanding priorities (what to give a f*ck about and what not to), a book about values in life. It will give you great clarity on what to care about and what not to. It attacks the usual self-help culture of “always be positive” and “always be happy”. Rather than telling you how to be happy, it makes you question a more general and important question of whether happiness is really the most important thing in life. Unlike usual self-help books, which paint an unrealistic rosy picture of the world, this book will teach you to take your life’s challenges head-on and grow from your pain, questioning what success means in the first place and how you should define it. It is not a feel-good book. You'll probably feel bad at points. But in the long run this book can change your life.</p>

<h3>A must-read for:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Anyone wondering how to be happy</li>
<li>Anyone wanting to get clarity on their life goals, what to strive for</li>
<li>Anyone feeling stuck in a boring, mundane lifestyle</li>
<li>Anyone who feels that the world is extremely unfair to them</li>
<li>Anyone waiting for the "hidden undiscovered genius" to come out and win the world</li>
<li>Anyone consuming a lot of self-help content but not seeing their life improving</li>
<li>Anyone feeling that they are not getting the rewards they deserve</li>
<li>Anyone who feels that they do not have the motivation to pursue anything good</li>
</ul>

<h3>What I liked the most in this book:</h3>

<li>The style of writing: extremely hard-hitting, grab-your-shoulders-and-shake-you-hard types</li>
<li>Ruthless acceptance of reality as it is, without any irrational beliefs</li>
<li>The way he has connected all the different areas of life ultimately to the same tenet of knowing what to give a f*ck about.</li>
