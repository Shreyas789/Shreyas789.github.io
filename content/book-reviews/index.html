<h1>Book Recommendations and Reviews</h1>

I consider myself an avid reader. In 2023, I read 35 books (and still counting). Here is where I have compiled some
book reviews and recommendations. Bold Font indicates that the book is one of my absolute favourites. For a complete list of books which I have read, you can check out my <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/145913296-shreyas-nadkarni">Goodreads profile</a>. Here, I have listed my favourites genre-wise, in no particular order. Some of them are just recommendations, some of them have short reviews, while some have longer detailed reviews. Happy reading!
