<h2>A Guide to the Good Life: The Ancient Art of Stoic Joy, by William Irvine</h2>

This book is an introduction to Stoicism, which is one of the Hellenistic philosophies of ancient Rome and Greece. Motivated by the teachings of great philosophers (mainly the Roman Stoics: Epictetus, Musonius Rufus, Seneca and Marcus Aurelius), the author has presented some amazing practical guidelines to put this philosophy to use in our twenty-first-century lives. Beginning with the history of Stoicism, the book is divided into four parts:
<ul>
<li>The Rise of Stoicism</li>
<li>Stoic Psychological Techniques</li>
<li>Stoic Advice</li>
<li>Stoicism for Modern Lives</li>
</ul>
<p>Stoicism is becoming popular, and the major reason for it is that it is simple, relatively easy to adopt and in tune with the human condition. The author describes the Stoics as “some of the most insightful psychologists of the ancient world” since by their observations they have left us a body of work and literature on what it means for life to be good, and how we can pursue it. The grand goal of this philosophy is to achieve “tranquillity”, which we often call “peace of mind”. It is the prospect of calming your inner voice and cherishing joy. I resonated a lot with this book which has given me a directive that I should adopt these principles in my life and dive deeper into it.</p>
</p>The book firstly entails why it is important to have a philosophy in life. Most humans lack a philosophy by which they measure their life, because of which their decision-making is based primarily on the natural mental make-up and emotions rather than rationality. Ideas such as delayed gratification have been accentuated by several religions and philosophies but hedonism takes the lead by default. To avoid ourselves from going the wrong path and finding long-lasting happiness, therefore, what we need is a coherent philosophy which helps us make decisions, design our lifestyle, as well as face the problems of daily life.</p>
</p>We often chase things we never actually want in life or end up feeling dissatisfied even after achieving the dreams we once had. The root cause of this according to modern science lies in evolutionary psychology. But what can we do to counter this inherently flawed nature of our brains which can potentially hinder us from living our life well? Are there some subtle changes we can make in our mindset and actions which enable us to find joy and tranquility, without compromising on reason and rationality? That is what this book, and Stoicism in general tries to answer. The book contains a serious philosophical treatment of issues that have pricked humanity since time immemorial, such as anger, grief, insults, etc, and discusses how the great Stoics handled them. It is interspersed with examples from modern life so it is a great blend of wisdom and informal writing.</p>

<h3>What I liked the most in the book:</h3>

<ul>
<li>The explanation of why it is important to have a philosophy of life, without which we might “mislive” and waste the one life we have got.</li>
<li>The realisation of how little human nature has changed over the millennia and the fact that ancient wisdom can be so relevant in today’s world. </li>
<li>How the author has debunked several myths about Stoicism, particularly the one that Stoics are “emotionless” or “lifeless”.</li>
<li>The scientific explanation (based on evolution) of the human condition and how Stoic principles can help mitigate our inherent flaws.</li>
<li>The author’s personal experience after adopting the philosophy, the costs and benefits.</li>
  <li>The analytical style of writing and building on a particular thought</li>
  </ul>
