<p>A book about how our species "Homo sapiens" has come from being a localized animal in the African Savanna to the strongest species on the planet. Enjoyable, knowledgeable, and transformational. It involves history, science, sociology, philosophy, etc., and is a fantastic blend of everything. The author has connected universal history to the present world we live in and has given some tremendous insights thereby. He has also described history in a logical, scientific fashion, unlike history textbooks and informational sources. The author's unmatched clarity of thinking and insight can be seen in his writing.</p>

<p>The book is divided into four parts: the cognitive revolution, the Agricultural Revolution, the Unification of Humankind, and the Scientific Revolution. It gives a bird's eye view of human history right from the beginning of the cognitive revolution, which started 70,000 years ago and transformed the human brain into what we know today. Starting from explaining what distinguishes humans from other animals, it gives a lot of valuable insights into how this species has managed to come such a long way in such a short time (short by evolutionary standards), from hunting game in Africa in 70,000 BC to launching space programs and building artificial intelligence today. You will understand the role of several forces such as evolution, culture, religion, empires, money, and science in influencing how history has unfolded over the millennia.</p>

<h3>What I liked the most in the book:</h3>

<ul>
<li>The lessons we can get from looking at history, to live in today's world. It's a book about the present and future, not just the past.</li>
<li>The scientific temperament in the arguments: discussion of contradicting theories and of what exactly we know and what we do not</li>
<li> Mind-boggling realizations that the way our world works today is just one of the multitude of possibilities is a result of many factors, and cannot be taken for granted or considered "obvious."</li>
<li>The discussion of Buddhism, craving, and suffering in Part 3 and of happiness towards the end of the book</li>
<li>The way evolution has played a significant role in shaping our psyche, thinking, and decision-making </li>
<li>An appreciation towards the luxuries we have today and how peaceful our world is (even if it does not seem to be so at first glance)</li>
</ul>

<p>This is a sequel of Sapiens and is about the future. There is some repetition with Sapiens but the author has done an extremely good job of making this book a great read in itself so it can be read before Sapiens too (but not recommended). It is more on the philosophical side than Sapiens and it has a lot of stuff about what humanity will pursue in future after having conquered basic survival and material issues. It will show you what science is going to offer in the next few decades, along with the roles and limitations of cultures, religions and humanism which have shaped our lives till this date and some intelligent speculation about how it might change in the next few decades or centuries with the advent of artificial intelligence, biotechnology, genetic engineering, etc. With the aid of upcoming technology, Homo Sapiens might become something like never before, a completely different kind of superhuman species which the author has called <i>Homo Deus</i>.</p>

<p>I personally liked Homo Deus more than Sapiens. It has only those parts of Sapiens repeated which are necessary to relate what is happening today and what will happen later, without too much focus on the historical details. The criticism of humanism is rather depressing, but is a revolutionary idea nevertheless.</p> 

<h3>What I liked the most in this book:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Educated predictions about how the world will be in the coming decades</li>
  <li>Discussion of humanism which we take for granted today</li>
  <li>Philosophical discussion of religions as systems that give factual arguments, ethical doctrines and practical guidelines</li>
  <li>Extremely gripping style of writing. The book is a page-turner, thrilling as well as enlightening.</li>

  <span class="book-title">The Brain: The Story of You</span><br>
  <span class="author">by David Eagleman</span>

<p>This book is a fascinating dive into how "the most complex object on the planet", namely the human brain, works. It covers multiple questions such as sensation, learning, experience, consciousness, emotions, and behavior. The book is an excellent introduction to the fascinating field of neuroscience. Each page is filled with astonishing facts about the brain. There are descriptions of experiments done and the insights obtained which enlighten us about the workings of this neuronal machine inside our skulls. The reader cannot help but appreciate the complexity and the ingenuity of the brain's design. The most incredible thing about the book is the simplicity of writing. There is no point in the book where it feels like the concepts are challenging to grasp, which happens in many science books. The analogies used by the author and the way he explains intricacies in clear, simple language make the book an engaging page-turner, a combination of knowledge and fun. You'll get a lot of "aha" moments while reading it!</p>

<p>I saw this book in my college library and picked it up to see what it had. Despite having seen recommendations and reviews of so many books over the past few months, I hadn't even come across the name of this one, so I expected it to be a not-so-good one. But I read it and it almost came as a shock to me; it was fabulous. It has excellent page-for-page wisdom and does not get dull at any point. It might be one of the most underrated booksâ€”a great first book for anyone wishing to explore reading popular science or non-fiction.</p>

<h3>The book is divided into 6 chapters:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Who am I?</li>
  <li>What is reality?</li>
  <li>Who's in control?</li>
  <li>How do I decide?</li>
  <li>Do I need you?</li>
  <li>Who will we be?</li>
</ul>

The last chapter is especially jaw-dropping, with all the future possibilities and speculations of where neuroscience research is going to take us. From advances in bionics (artificial senses and limbs) to uploading our consciousness to the internet, this chapter can make you squirm in your seats, similar to sections in other futurism books like Homo Deus. It will show you what's about to come and how powerful our species is going to become with the tools of science, equipped to carve out its own destiny.

<h3>What I liked the most about the book:</h3>

<ul>
<li>The analogies used to explain the brain, for example the brain being like a city</li>
<li>The simplicity of writing and clarity in the explanations without technical jargon</li>
<li>Great quality of content in a limited number of pages: Many pop-science books are long and difficult to finish, but this book was an exception</li>
<li>The way the author has brought out the theme of appreciation of the brain's complexity and Mother Nature's design secrets</li>
</ul>
