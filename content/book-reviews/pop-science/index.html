<h2>Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind, by Yuval Noah Harari</h2>

</div>

<p>A book about how our species "Homo sapiens" has come from being a localized animal in the African Savanna to the strongest species on the planet. Enjoyable, knowledgeable, and transformational. It involves history, science, sociology, philosophy, etc., and is a fantastic blend of everything. The author has connected universal history to the present world we live in and has given some tremendous insights thereby. He has also described history in a logical, scientific fashion, unlike history textbooks and informational sources. The author's unmatched clarity of thinking and insight can be seen in his writing.</p>

<p>The book is divided into four parts: the cognitive revolution, the Agricultural Revolution, the Unification of Humankind, and the Scientific Revolution. It gives a bird's eye view of human history right from the beginning of the cognitive revolution, which started 70,000 years ago and transformed the human brain into what we know today. Starting from explaining what distinguishes humans from other animals, it gives a lot of valuable insights into how this species has managed to come such a long way in such a short time (short by evolutionary standards), from hunting game in Africa in 70,000 BC to launching space programs and building artificial intelligence today. You will understand the role of several forces such as evolution, culture, religion, empires, money, and science in influencing how history has unfolded over the millennia.</p>

<h3>What I liked the most in the book:</h3>

<ul>
<li>The lessons we can get from looking at history, to live in today's world. It's a book about the present and future, not just the past.</li>
<li>The scientific temperament in the arguments: discussion of contradicting theories and of what exactly we know and what we do not</li>
<li> Mind-boggling realizations that the way our world works today is just one of the multitude of possibilities is a result of many factors, and cannot be taken for granted or considered "obvious."</li>
<li>The discussion of Buddhism, craving, and suffering in Part 3 and of happiness towards the end of the book</li>
<li>The way evolution has played a significant role in shaping our psyche, thinking, and decision-making </li>
<li>An appreciation towards the luxuries we have today and how peaceful our world is (even if it does not seem to be so at first glance)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow, by Yuval Noah Harari</h2>

</div>

<p>This is a sequel of Sapiens and is about the future. There is some repetition with Sapiens but the author has done an extremely good job of making this book a great read in itself so it can be read before Sapiens too (but not recommended). It is more on the philosophical side than Sapiens and it has a lot of stuff about what humanity will pursue in future after having conquered basic survival and material issues. It will show you what science is going to offer in the next few decades, along with the roles and limitations of cultures, religions and humanism which have shaped our lives till this date and some intelligent speculation about how it might change in the next few decades or centuries with the advent of artificial intelligence, biotechnology, genetic engineering, etc. With the aid of upcoming technology, Homo Sapiens might become something like never before, a completely different kind of superhuman species which the author has called <i>Homo Deus</i>.</p>

<p>I personally liked Homo Deus more than Sapiens. It has only those parts of Sapiens repeated which are necessary to relate what is happening today and what will happen later, without too much focus on the historical details. The criticism of humanism is rather depressing, but is a revolutionary idea nevertheless.</p> 

<h3>What I liked the most in this book:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Educated predictions about how the world will be in the coming decades</li>
  <li>Discussion of humanism which we take for granted today</li>
  <li>Philosophical discussion of religions as systems that give factual arguments, ethical doctrines and practical guidelines</li>
  <li>Extremely gripping style of writing. The book is a page-turner, thrilling as well as enlightening.</li>
</ul>
