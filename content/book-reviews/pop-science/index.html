A book about how our species "Homo sapiens" has come from being a localized animal in the African Savanna to the strongest species on the planet. Enjoyable, knowledgeable, and transformational. It involves history, science, sociology, philosophy, etc., and is a fantastic blend of everything. The author has connected universal history to the present world we live in and has given some tremendous insights thereby. He has also described history in a logical, scientific fashion, unlike history textbooks and informational sources. Truly mind-boggling. The author's unmatched clarity of thinking and insight can be seen in his writing.

The book is divided into four parts: the cognitive revolution, the Agricultural Revolution, the Unification of Humankind, and the Scientific Revolution. It gives a bird's eye view of human history right from the beginning of the cognitive revolution, which started 70,000 years ago and transformed the human brain into what we know today. Starting from explaining what distinguishes humans from other animals, it gives a lot of valuable insights into how this species has managed to come such a long way in such a short time (short by evolutionary standards), from hunting game in Africa in 70,000 BC to launching space programs and building artificial intelligence today. You will understand the role of several forces such as evolution, culture, religion, empires, money, and science in influencing how history has unfolded over the millennia.

<h3>What I liked the most in the book:</h3>

<ul>
<li>The lessons we can get from looking at history, to live in today's world. It's a book about the present and future, not just the past.</li>
<li>The scientific temperament in the arguments: discussion of contradicting theories and of what exactly we know and what we do not</li>
<li> Mind-boggling realizations that the way our world works today is just one of the multitude of possibilities is a result of many factors, and cannot be taken for granted or considered "obvious."</li>
<li>The discussion of Buddhism, craving, and suffering in Part 3 and of happiness towards the end of the book</li>
<li>The way evolution has played a significant role in shaping our psyche, thinking, and decision-making </li>
<li>An appreciation towards the luxuries we have today and how peaceful our world is (even if it does not seem to be so at first glance)</li>
</ul>
