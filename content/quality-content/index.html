<h1>Quality Content</h1>

In this section I have listed my favourite stuff, which I will recommend to anyone. The internet is brimming with unlimited sources and information. It becomes important to cut through the crap and find stuff that really adds value to our wisdom. Therefore, here I have listed channels, blogs and people who I follow in order to live a better, well-informed life. Enjoy!

<h2>YouTube channels that inspire me:</h2>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Einzelganger">Einzelganger</a>: Ancient philosophical wisdom for modern life. His videos on Taoism, Stoicism, Buddhism and other schools of thought are too good. They focus a lot on problems in modern culture, consumerism, hustle-culture and give great advice on seeking inner peace, inspied by great philosophers</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@theschooloflifetv">The School of Life</a>: Another channel with lots of wisdom to offer. They also focus on topics such as mental health, relationships, modern culture, childhood experiences, parenting and love. The breadth of topics this channel covers is astounding as much as the impeccable quality and to-the-point advice.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@IAmMarkManson">Mark Manson</a>: He is the author of the bestseller <i>The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck</i>. He takes timeless wisdom and modern scientific research and packages it so well for modern viewers that he sounds like a trusted friend rather than an influencer. Filled with amazing stock images and humorous punches, his videos have impacted my life in great ways!</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@BuddhismInEnglish">Buddhism</a>: This channel contains short life advice videos based on Buddhist ideas. I love the serene and calm manner of the speaker monk. Listening to him calms me down and uplifts my mood.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/dhruvrathee">Dhruv Rathee</a>: Well curated videos about Indian history, current affairs and many more.</li>

</ul>

<h2>My Favourite Blogs:</h2>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://collabfund.com/blog/authors/morgan/">Collaborative Fund</a>: Morgan Housel, the author of <i>The Psychology of Money</i> is one of the contributors at Collab Fund. Morgan's multidisciplinary wisdom and his ability to find connections between different fields and topics and ultimately applying them to finance and life is just unparalleled</li>
