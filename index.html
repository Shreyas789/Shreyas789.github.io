    <p> Welcome to my website!</p>
    <p> Here you can find my profile, academic endeavours, projects, and extra-curricular interests. I am a student of IIT Bombay pursuing Data Science, and most of my projects include Python programming. Writing a piece of code and seeing it work makes me happy.</p>

    <p>If you are interested, do check out the Reading section where I have compiled book recommendations and reviews.</p>
    
    <p> Cheers!</p>

<div id="about-me" style="display: none;">
<h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>I am 22 years of age. I live in Mumbai. I am pursuing a Dual Degree at <b>IIT Bombay</b>: B.Tech in <b>Electrical Engineering</b> and M.Tech in <b>Artificial Intelligence and Data Science</b>. </p>
  <p>I am a budding Data Scientist and ML engineer. Developing intelligent systems for automation and building end-to-end pipelines for their seamless working interests me quite a lot. My key area of expertise is <b>Python</b> programming for system development, data processing and ML. I have completed multiple projects in Python over the last 4 years.</p>
  <p> For my masters thesis, I am working in the field of Music Information Retrieval on a task aimed at finding correspondence between mutiple modalities in Hindustani classical music performances. Through the same I managed to publish a paper at International Society of Music Information Retrival (ISMIR), 2023 in Milan, Italy and am currently working towards a related Journal paper submission. I am also a research assistant at Digital Audio Processing Lab, IIT Bombay. My work has involved extensive amounts of <b>data processing</b>, scripting and <b>pipeline development</b> in Python. I have some background knowledge in Indian Classicial Music which also contributes towards my work.</p>

  <p>I am going to start my first full-time job at NoBroker Technologies Solutions Pvt Ltd. in August 2024 as an Associate Data Scientist. The work involves natural language processing and Python development</p>

  <h3>My Technical Interests</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Python development</li>
    <li>Speech and audio processing</li>
    <li>Natural Language Processing</li>
    <li>Data analytics, statistics</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>My Non-Technical academic interests</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Economics (especially behavioral economics)</li>
    <li>Psychology (especially managerial psychology, mental health)</li>
    <li>Philosophy</li>
    <li>Any other stuff that is intellectually stimulating</li>
  </ul>
  I have completed several courses in Humanities and Social Sciences at IIT Bombay as a part of "Additional Learning" and I hold a keen interest in this domain. I believe that knowledge of humanities is non-negotiable if we want to make the world a better place. We need more and more individuals who are skilled in both technology and humanities if we want to make life better in the 21st century.
