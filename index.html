  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>I am 22 years of age. I live in Mumbai. I am pursuing a Dual Degree at <b>IIT Bombay</b>: B.Tech in <b>Electrical Engineering</b> and M.Tech in <b>Artificial Intelligence and Data Science</b>. </p>
  <p> For my masters thesis, I am working in the field of Music Information Retrieval on a task aimed at finding correspondence between mutiple modalities in Hindustani classical music performances. I am also a research assistant at Digital Audio Processing Lab, IIT Bombay.</p>
  <p>I am a budding Data Scientist and ML engineer. Developing intelligent systems for automation and building end-to-end pipelines for their seamless working interests me quite a lot. My key area of expertise is <b>Python</b> programming for system development, data processing and ML. I have completed multiple projects in Python over the last 4 years.</p>
